This is the repository for the code and replication data used in my master's thesis. 
The script used is in R Markdown format and is Duarte Amaro - Code.Rmd. 

The graphs included are also saved here in the files folder and in the Duarte Amaro - Code.md file.

Data sources are discussed in pages 22-26 of my thesis.
